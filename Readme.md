Rewrite of playcurl, work in progress.

- Added action.sh

DO NOT USE UNTIL STABLE.

# How to

- Flash the module

- At every boot the fp will be pulled

- Every 30 mins the updated fp will be downloaded (you can change the time in seconds in "/data/adb/modules/playcurlNEXT/seconds.txt")

# Additional

- You can trigger the action too if you have magisk canary

- You can run the script on termux too, the command is : su -c 'fp'
